# dotfiles


## Installation
Run script:
$ ./install.sh

## TODO
- info/error from functions usage
- move addFile to functions and eliminate index
- install related functions move from bash-functions to ?
- start-programs.sh -> other_name.sh

## Bugs
- Thunderbird don't write filters to created symlinks during installtion
- Problem with setting HISTSIZE: bash_history is small
